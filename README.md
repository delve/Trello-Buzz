just working through the proposed problem


So at a Fermi estimate of 2 quadrillion combinations by the time my naive, brute force algorithm test is complete on any consumer class hardware there may very well not be a sun to shed light on the results.

Granted, there's no threading and I'm sure it's an optimization nightmare but 2E+15 is still a lot even if it were.
